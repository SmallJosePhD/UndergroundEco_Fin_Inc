# The underground economy-financial inclusion relationship in West African countries: Evidence from dynamic heterogeneous panel estimation technique

## **Abstract:**
We employ dynamic heterogeneous panel estimation techniques which include Dynamic Fixed Effects (DFE), Mean Group (MG), and Pooled Mean Group (PMG) estimators to
explore the underground economy (UE) and financial inclusion (FI) relation for ten West African nations during the 2004-2021 period. Applying Pedroni cointegration test, the results present evidence of a long-term relation between UE and FI (alongside corruption, inflation rate, money supply, agricultural output, and trade). The results of panel estimation portray a long-term significant positive influence of FI on UE, but a short-term significant negative relation between FI and UE. In addition, corruption, money supply, and international trade have a long-term significant negative influence on UE, while inflation supports long-term
expansion of UE. Also, a short-term significant negative relation exists between inflation (and trade) and UE, while a short-term significant positive relation is found between money supply and UE. The results of Dumitrescu-Hurlin causality test signal a one-way causality from FI to UE. Therefore, policies geared towards enhancing FI, reducing corruption and money supply, and improving international trade are recommended to reduce UE.

Before the analysis, the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was adopted to generate a multidimensional Financial Inclusion Index (FII). The Stata codes for the PCA and the DFE, MG, and PMG estimation techniques are presented here for replication.
